Release history for lariza

next
  [Changed]
  - Web extensions are now looked for in ~/.config/lariza/web_extensions.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Changed]
  - Except for the default window size, there are no hardcoded pixel
    values anymore. Should make it a little easier to run lariza on
    HiDPI screens. (Sorry, not tested, I don't have one.)

  [Added]
  - New key bindings F2 and F3: Select previous or next search result
    on page.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Issue #14: "Keypad enter" now registers as "commit", i.e. "start
    loading the URL" or "begin searching for search term".
  - Issue #15: lariza no longer tries to create local file names with
    directory separators in them when downloading files.
  - lariza no longer sets the window title to an empty string.

  [Changed]
  - For the sake of consistency, $LARIZA_WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIR has been
    removed.

  [Added]
  - Manpages are now available.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
